# Standard curriculum learning evaluation
We simplify current curriculum learning methods and use standard curriculum learning (Paced learning) to compare different precomputed image difficulty scores head-to-head.

Image difficulty scores are saved in ./orders

We provide an unofficial implementation of Prediction Depth.

# Acknowledgement
The implementation of standard curriculum learning borrow wisdom from the following works:
